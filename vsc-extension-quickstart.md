# Quick Start Guide for Developing a VS Code Extension

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your development environment for creating a Visual Studio Code extension using TypeScript.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and the VS Code Extension Generator:
  ```
  npm install -g yo generator-code
  ```

### Setting Up Your Extension

1. **Create Your Extension**: 
   Use the generator to scaffold a new extension:
   ```
   yo code
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up your extension.

2. **Open Your Extension in VS Code**:
   Navigate to your extension folder and open it in VS Code:
   ```
   cd my-vscode-extension
   code .
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command in the terminal to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Development

- **Editing Your Code**: 
  Your main extension code is located in `src/extension.ts`. Modify this file to implement your extension's functionality.

- **Debugging Your Extension**: 
  Press `F5` to start debugging. This will open a new VS Code window with your extension loaded.

### Common Tasks

- **Building Your Extension**: 
  To compile your TypeScript code, run:
  ```
  npm run compile
  ```

- **Packaging Your Extension**: 
  To package your extension for distribution, use the `vsce` tool:
  ```
  npm install -g vsce
  vsce package
  ```

### Publishing Your Extension

1. Create a publisher account on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
2. Use the `vsce` tool to publish your extension:
   ```
   vsce publish
   ```
